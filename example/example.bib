These proposed applications are embedded in a uniform optical fiber and require no special device fabrication, no cooling, and no vacuum.},

	abstract = {We study the stability of a Bose-Einstein condensate of harmonically trapped atoms with negative scattering length, specifically 7Li. Our method is to solve the time-dependent nonlinear Schrödinger equation numerically. For an isolated condensate, with no gain or loss, we find that the system is stable (apart from quantum tunneling) if the particle number N is less than a critical number Nc. For N{\textgreater}Nc, the system collapses to high-density clumps in a region near the center of the trap. The time for the onset of collapse is on the order of one trap period. Within numerical uncertainty, the results are consistent with the formation of a “black hole” of infinite density fluctuations, as predicted by Ueda and Huang [Phys. Rev. A (to be published)]. We numerically obtain Nc≈1251. We then include gain-loss mechanisms, i.e., the gain of atoms from a surrounding “thermal cloud,” and the loss due to two- and three-body collisions. The number N now oscillates in a steady state, with a period of about 145 trap periods. We obtain Nc≈1260 as the maximum value in the oscillations.},

A classical problem concerning the motion of a single solitary wave is used to compare the first, second and fourth-order schemes in terms of the accuracy and the computational cost. This numerical experiment shows that the split-step Fourier method provides highly accurate solutions for the {GNLS} equation and that the fourth-order scheme is computationally more efficient than the first-order and second-order schemes. Furthermore, two test problems concerning the interaction of two solitary waves and an exact solution that blows up in finite time, respectively, are investigated by using the fourth-order split-step scheme and particular attention is paid to the conserved quantities as an indicator of the accuracy. The question how the present numerical results are related to those obtained in the literature is discussed.},

The cases of Ω≫1 and Ω≪1 correspond to the “pancake” (nearly-2D) and “cigar-shaped” (nearly-1D) configurations, respectively (in the latter limit, the vortices become “tubular” solitons). The analysis is based on the 3D Gross–Pitaevskii equation. The family of solutions with vorticity S=1 is accurately predicted by the variational approximation. The relative size of the stability area for the vortices with S=1 (which was studied, in a part, before) increases with the decrease of Ω in terms of the number of atoms, but decreases in terms of the chemical potential. All states with S⩾2 are unstable, while the stability of the ordinary solitons (S=0) obeys the Vakhitov–Kolokolov criterion. The stability predictions are verified by direct simulations of the full 3D equation.},

We demonstrate the three-dimensional (3D) character of the interactions in the case relevant to ongoing experiments, where the number of atoms in the soliton is relatively close to the collapse threshold. We examine the soliton dynamics in the framework of the effectively one-dimensional (1D) nonpolynomial Schrödinger equation ({NPSE}), which admits the collapse in a modified form, and in parallel we use the full 3D Gross–Pitaevskii equation ({GPE}). Both approaches produce similar results, which are, however, quite different from those produced in recent work that used the 1D cubic {GPE}. Basic features, produced by the {NPSE} and the 3D {GPE} alike, include (a) an increase in the first reflection coefficient for increasing barrier height and decreasing atom number; (b) large variation of the secondary reflection/recombination probability versus barrier height; (c) pronounced asymmetry in the oscillation amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected fragments; and (d) enhancement of the transverse excitations as the number of atoms is increased. We also explore effects produced by variations of the barrier width and outcomes of the secondary collision upon phase imprinting on the fragment in one arm of the interferometer.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we prove the energy diminishing of a normalized gradient ﬂow which provides a mathematical justiﬁcation of the imaginary time method used in physical literatures to compute the ground state solution of Bose-Einstein condensates ({BEC}). We also investigate the energy diminishing property for the discretization of the normalized gradient ﬂow. Two numerical methods are proposed for such discretizations: one is the backward Euler centered ﬁnite diﬀerence ({BEFD}), the other one is an explicit time-splitting sine-spectral ({TSSP}) method. Energy diminishing for {BEFD} and {TSSP} for linear case, and monotonicity for {BEFD} for both linear and nonlinear cases are proven. Comparison between the two methods and existing methods, e.g. Crank-Nicolson ﬁnite diﬀerence ({CNFD}) or forward Euler ﬁnite diﬀerence ({FEFD}), shows that {BEFD} and {TSSP} are much better in terms of preserving energy diminishing property of the normalized gradient ﬂow. Numerical results in 1d, 2d and 3d with magnetic trap conﬁnement potential, as well as a potential of a stirrer corresponding to a far-blue detuned Gaussian laser beam are reported to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of {BEFD} and {TSSP} methods. Furthermore we observe that the normalized gradient ﬂow can also be applied directly to compute the ﬁrst excited state solution in {BEC} when the initial data is chosen as an odd function.},

	abstract = {The achievement of Bose–Einstein condensation in ultra-cold vapours of alkali atoms has given enormous impulse to the study of dilute atomic gases in condensed quantum states inside magnetic traps and optical lattices. High-purity and easy optical access make them ideal candidates to investigate fundamental issues on interacting quantum systems. This review presents some theoretical issues which have been addressed in this area and the numerical techniques which have been developed and used to describe them, from mean-field models to classical and quantum simulations for equilibrium and dynamical properties. After an introductory overview on dilute quantum gases, both in the homogeneus state and under harmonic or periodic confinement, the article is organized in three main sections. The first concerns Bose-condensed gases at zero temperature, with main regard to the properties of the ground state in different confinements and to collective excitations and transport in the condensate. Bose–Einstein-condensed gases at finite temperature are addressed in the next section, the main emphasis being on equilibrium properties and phase transitions and on dynamical and transport properties associated with the presence of the thermal cloud. Finally, the last section is focused on theoretical and computational issues that have emerged from the efforts to drive gases of fermionic atoms and boson–fermion mixtures deep into the quantum degeneracy regime, with the aim of realizing novel superfluids from fermion pairing. The attention given in this article to methods beyond standard mean-field approaches should make it a useful reference point for future advances in these areas.},

	abstract = {Bose–Einstein condensates with attractive interactions have stable 1D solutions in the form of bright solitary-waves. These solitary waves behave, in the absence of external potentials, like macroscopic quantum particles. This opens up a wide array of applications for the testing of quantum mechanical behaviours and precision measurement. Here we investigate these applications with particular focus on the 
interactions of bright solitary-waves with narrow potential barriers. 
We first study bright solitons in the Gross–Pitaevskii equation as they are split on Gaussian and δ-function barriers, and then on Gaussian barriers in a low energy 
system. We present analytic and numerical results determining the general region in which a soliton may not be split on a finite width potential barrier. Furthermore, 
we test the sensitivity of the system to quantum fluctuations. 
We then study fast-moving bright solitons colliding at a narrow Gaussian potential barrier. In the limiting case of a δ-function barrier, we show analytically that the relative norms of the outgoing waves depends sinusoidally on the relative phase of the incoming waves, and determine whether the outgoing waves are bright solitons. We use numerical simulations to show that outside the high velocity limit nonlinear effects introduce a skew to the phase-dependence. 
Finally, we use these results to analyse the process of soliton interferometry. We develop analyses of both toroidal and harmonic trapping geometries for Mach–Zehnder interferometry, and then two implementations of a toroidal Sagnac inter- ferometer, also giving the analytical determination of the Sagnac phase in such systems. These results are again verified numerically. In the Mach–Zehnder case, we again probe the systems sensitivity to quantum fluctuations.},

	abstract = {We consider two models of interacting Bose gases: a gas of spin one particles in the ground state of a cubic box and a one-dimensional Bose gas with contact interactions. We show how to calculate exact eigenstates of the corresponding N-body Hamiltonians. Both models share the property of not leading to the formation of a Bose–Einstein condensate, even at zero temperature, in the strict sense of the existence of a single one-particle state with a macroscopic population. We show that a lot of physical insight can be gained on these two model systems by using the usual Hartree–Fock mean field approach: in this approximation, that we test against the exact result, everything happens as if a single realization of the system was a Bose–Einstein condensate in a state φ breaking the rotational or translational symmetry, and varying in a random way for any new experimental realization.
Résumé
Nous étudions deux modèles de gaz de Bose avec interactions : (i) un gaz de particules de spin un dans le niveau fondamental d'une boı̂te cubique, et (ii) un gaz de Bose unidimensionnel avec un potentiel d'interaction attractif. Nous déterminons de façon exacte les états propres des Hamiltoniens à N corps correspondants, ce qui nous permet de montrer que ces systèmes modèles ne forment pas de condensat de Bose–Einstein dans l'acception stricte du terme : même à température nulle ; il n'existe pas un et un seul état à une particule macroscopiquement peuplé. Nous montrons que l'approximation habituelle de champ moyen de type Hartree–Fock, dont nous contrôlons l'exactitude au moyen de la solution exacte, donne une représentation physique simple de l'état fondamental de ces systèmes modèles : tout se passe comme si chaque réalisation expérimentale du système de N particules était un condensat de Bose–Einstein dans un état à une particule φ à symétrie brisée, c'est-à-dire un état non invariant par rotation (pour le gaz de spins) ou par translation spatiale (pour le gaz unidimensionnel), cet état φ variant de façon imprédictible d'une réalisation expérimentale à l'autre.},

Simulating collisions between two solitons in the same setting, we find a critical velocity, Vc, below which merger of identical in-phase solitons is observed. Dependence of Vc on the strength of the transverse confinement and number of atoms in the solitons is predicted by means of the perturbation theory and investigated in direct simulations. The simulations also demonstrate symmetry breaking in collisions of identical solitons with a nonzero phase difference.

The critical branches for collapse due to the three-dimensional character of the gas and explosion caused by the expulsive potential are derived based on variational studies. Weak excitations of the soliton due to sudden changes in the trapping potential and/or or the scattering length are shown to damp exponentially by the emission of a small fraction of particles. It is shown that higher-order solitons can also be created in present experiments by an abrupt change of a factor of 4 in the scattering length. Finally, it is demonstrated that quantum evaporation occurs by nonlinear tunneling of particles out of the soliton, leading eventually to its explosion.},

Such solitary-matter waves are excellent candidates for highly sensitive interferometers, as their non-dispersive nature allows them to acquire phase shifts for longer times than conventional matter-wave interferometers. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally the splitting and recombination of a bright-solitary-matter wave on a narrow repulsive barrier, realizing the fundamental components of an interferometer. We show that for a sufficiently narrow barrier, interference-mediated recombination can dominate over velocity-filtering effects. Our theoretical analysis shows that interference-mediated recombination is extremely sensitive to the barrier position, predicting strong oscillations in the interferometer output as the barrier position is adjusted over just a few micrometres. These results highlight the potential of soliton interferometry, while putting tight constraints on the barrier stability needed in future experimental implementations.},

	abstract = {We investigate scattering bright solitons off a potential using both analytical and numerical methods. Our paper focuses on low kinetic energies for which differences between the mean-field description via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation ({GPE}) and the quantum behavior are particularly large. On the N-particle quantum level, adding an additional harmonic confinement leads to a simple signature to distinguish quantum superpositions from statistical mixtures. While the nonlinear character of the {GPE} does not allow quantum superpositions, the splitting of {GPE} solitons takes place only partially. When the potential strength is increased, the fraction of the soliton which is transmitted or reflected jumps noncontinuously. We explain these jumps via energy conservation and interpret them as indications for quantum superpositions on the N-particle level. On the {GPE} level, we also investigate the transition from this stepwise behavior to the continuous case.},

These two solitons recombine after a dipole oscillation in the trap at the position of the barrier. We focus on the characterization of the splitting process in the case in which the reflected and transmitted solitons have the same number of atoms. We obtain that the velocity of the split solitons strongly depends on the nonlinearity and on the width of the barrier and that the reflected soliton is in general slower than the transmitted one. Also, we study the phase difference acquired between the two solitons during the splitting and we fit semianalytically the main dependences with the velocity of the incident soliton, the nonlinearity, and the width of the barrier. The implementation of the full interferometer sequence is tested by means of the phase imprinting method.},

	abstract = {We report results of systematic numerical simulations of collisions between a soliton and an attractive defect described by the perturbing term in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation proportional to the δ-function. This model has applications in nonlinear optics and other physical systems. In the parametric range where the defect's strength is of the same order of magnitude as the soliton's amplitude, i.e., the interaction is essentially nonlinear, only two outcomes of the collision are possible: transmission and capture. We have found a border between the corresponding parametric regions. The border is represented in a universal form which does not depend on any free parameter. In this essentially nonlinear regime of the interaction, the soliton keeps its integrity, being transmitted or captured as a whole, practically without emission of radiation. At larger values of the defect's strength, the interaction becomes nearly linear. In this case, the soliton is split into reflected, transmitted, and trapped wave packets. Using the corresponding linear Schrödinger equation, we calculate analytically the shares of the reflected and transmitted energy in the limiting case when the defect's strength and the soliton's velocity are essentially larger than its amplitude.},

In particular, we consider algorithms involving real- and imaginary-time propagation based on a split-step Crank–Nicolson method. In a one-space-variable form of the {GP} equation we consider the one-dimensional, two-dimensional circularly-symmetric, and the three-dimensional spherically-symmetric harmonic-oscillator traps. In the two-space-variable form we consider the {GP} equation in two-dimensional anisotropic and three-dimensional axially-symmetric traps. The fully-anisotropic three-dimensional {GP} equation is also considered. Numerical results for the chemical potential and root-mean-square size of stationary states are reported using imaginary-time propagation programs for all the cases and compared with previously obtained results. Also presented are numerical results of non-stationary oscillation for different trap symmetries using real-time propagation programs. A set of convenient working codes developed in Fortran 77 are also provided for all these cases (twelve programs in all). In the case of two or three space variables, Fortran 90/95 versions provide some simplification over the Fortran 77 programs, and these programs are also included (six programs in all).

	abstract = {In the present work, we theoretically propose and numerically illustrate a mean-field analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment with bright solitons. More specifically, we scatter two solitons off of each other (in our setup, the bright solitons play the role of a classical analog to the quantum photons of the original experiment), while the role of the beam splitter is played by a repulsive Gaussian barrier. In our classical scenario, distinguishability of the particles yields, as expected, a 0.5 split mass on either side. Nevertheless, for very slight deviations from the completely symmetric scenario, a near-perfect transmission can be constructed instead, very similarly to the quantum-mechanical output. We demonstrate this as a generic feature under slight variations of the relative soliton speed, or of the relative amplitude in a wide parametric regime. We also explore how variations of the properties of the “beam splitter” (i.e., the Gaussian barrier) affect this phenomenology.},

	abstract = {We model the dynamics of attractively interacting ultracold bosonic atoms in a quasi-one-dimensional wave guide with additional harmonic trapping. Initially, we prepare the system in its ground state and then shift the zero of the harmonic trap and switch on an additional narrow scattering potential near the center of the trap. After colliding with the barrier twice, we propose to measure the number of atoms opposite the initial condition. Quantum-enhanced interferometry with quantum bright solitons allows us to predict detection of an offset of the scattering potential with considerably increased precision as compared to single-particle experiments. In a future experimental realization this might lead to measurement of weak forces caused, for example, by small horizontal gradients in the gravitational potential—with a resolution of several micrometers given essentially by the size of the solitons. Our numerical simulations are based on the rigorously proved effective potential approach developed in previous papers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 010403 (2009) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210402 (2009)]. We choose our parameters such that the prerequisite of the proof (that the solitons cannot break apart, for energetic reasons) is always fulfilled, thus exploring a parameter regime inaccessible to the mean-field description via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation due to Schrödinger-cat states occurring in the many-particle quantum dynamics.},

Good agreement is found between the particle model and simulations of the full wave dynamics, suggesting that the dynamics can be described in terms of solitons both in regular and chaotic regimes, presenting a paradigm for chaos in wave mechanics.},

The experimental capacity to precisely engineer the nonlinearity and potential landscape experienced by these solitary waves offers an attractive platform for fundamental study of solitonic structures. The presence of three spatial dimensions and trapping implies that these are strictly distinct objects to the true soliton solutions. Working within the zero-temperature mean-field description, we explore the solutions and stability of bright solitary waves, as well as their interactions. Emphasis is placed on elucidating their similarities and differences to the true bright soliton. The rich behaviour introduced in the bright solitary waves includes the collapse instability and asymmetric collisions. We review the experimental formation and observation of bright solitary matter waves to date, and compare to theoretical predictions. Finally we discuss some topical aspects, including beyond-mean-field descriptions, symmetry breaking, exotic bright solitary waves, and proposals to exploit bright solitary waves in interferometry and as surface probes.},

Condensates constrained to one-dimensional motion with attractive interactions are predicted to form stable solitons, in which the attractive forces exactly compensate for wave-packet dispersion1. Here we report the formation of bright solitons of 7Li atoms in a quasi-one-dimensional optical trap, by magnetically tuning the interactions in a stable Bose–Einstein condensate from repulsive to attractive. The solitons are set in motion by offsetting the optical potential, and are observed to propagate in the potential for many oscillatory cycles without spreading. We observe a soliton train, containing many solitons; repulsive interactions between neighbouring solitons are inferred from their motion.},

	abstract = {In spite of the huge progress in studies on solitary waves in the seventies and eighties of the {XX} century as well as their practical importance, the theory of solitons is far from being complete. Only in 1989, Longuet-Higgins in his numerical experiments discovered one-dimensional solitons for gravity–capillary waves in deep water. These solitons essentially differed from those in shallow water where the {KDV} equation could be used. Being localized, these solitons, unlike the {KDV} solitons, contain many oscillations in their shape. The number of oscillations was found to increase while approaching the maximal phase velocity for linear gravity–capillary waves and simultaneously the soliton amplitude was demonstrated to vanish. In fact, it was the first time ever that the bifurcation of solitons was observed. This review discusses bifurcations of solitons, both supercritical and subcritical, with applications to fluids and nonlinear optics as well. The main attention is paid to the universality of soliton behavior and stability of solitons while approaching supercritical bifurcations. For all physical models considered in this review, solitons are stationary points of the corresponding Hamiltonian for the fixed integrals of motion, i.e., the total momentum, number of quasi-particles, etc. Two approaches are used for the soliton stability analysis. The first method is based on the Lyapunov theory and another one is connected with the linear stability criterion of the Vakhitov–Kolokolov type. The Lyapunov stability proof is maintained by means of application of the integral majorized inequalities being sequences of the Sobolev embedding theorem. This allows one to demonstrate the boundedness of the Hamiltonians and show that solitons, as stationary points, which realize the minimum (or maximum) of the Hamiltonian, are stable in the Lyapunov sense. In the case of unstable solitons, the nonlinear stage of their instability near the bifurcation point results in the distraction of the solitons due to the wave collapse.},
